    <ul>
        <li>My favorite place in Colombia is Bogotá D.C. because it's the city where I was born. I'm going to show you the best places in Bogotá and give you the directions.</li>

        <li>The first place is Mall Center, a big mall with many interesting shops. If you live near Jumbo on 30th Avenue, go straight until you see the Homecenter sign, then turn right and you’ll be there.</li>

        <li>The second place is also great if you live near Bosa Porvenir. Its name is Trebolis Mall. If you live on 94th Avenue, turn right until you see a clothing store called 'Beautiful Clothing Store'. Then turn left, and at the end of 50th Street South, you’ll reach your destination!</li>

        <li>The last place is located in the neighborhood called Las Nieves. If you live there, there’s a mall called Rampicentro. Its address is 10th Avenue with 20th Street, number 39. It sells computer products. If you live on 7th Avenue, go straight until you reach 22nd Street, then turn left and keep going straight until you reach 10th Avenue. Turn left again, and when you see the mall, cross the street in front of you and you’re there!</li>

    </ul>
